- Creating repositories using TypeORM
  - When using type ORM, we do not have to create repository files manually as we did on our last application. Instead, these repositories are going to be created for us automatically behind the scenes. We don't even end up seeing a generated file or anything like that, we just see classes that will be created for us.
